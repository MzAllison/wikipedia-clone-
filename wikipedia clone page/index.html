        Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti (born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti; 
        15 October 1938 – 2 August 1997) was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, 
        bandleader, composer, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. 
        He is regarded as the pioneer of Afrobeat, an African music genre that combines traditional Yoruba with funk and jazz.
        [1] At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most "challenging and charismatic music performers".
        [2] AllMusic described him as a "musical and sociopolitical voice" of international significance.[3]
        Kuti was the son of a Nigerian women's rights activist, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. After early experiences abroad, 
        he and his band Africa 70 (featuring drummer Tony Allen) shot to stardom in Nigeria during the 1970s,
        during which he was an outspoken critic and target of Nigeria's military juntas.[3] In 1970,
        he founded the Kalakuta Republic commune, which declared itself independent from military rule.
        The commune was destroyed in a 1978 raid.[4] Since his death in 1997,
        reissues and compilations of his music have been overseen by his son, Femi Kuti.

            <p >
                Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti[5] was born into the Ransome-Kuti family, 
                an upper-middle-class Nigerian family, on 15 October 1938 in Abeokuta (the modern-day capital of Ogun State[6]), 
                which at the time was a city in the British Colony of Nigeria.[7] 
                His mother, Chief Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was an anti-colonial feminist,
                 and his father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister,
                  school principal, and the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers.[8] 
                  His brothers Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors,
                   were well known nationally.[4] Kuti was a first cousin once removed to the writer
                    and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, the first black African to win the Nobel Prize for Literature,
                 as they are both descendants of Josiah Ransome-Kuti, who is Kuti's paternal grandfather and 
                 Soyinka's maternal great-grandfather.[9]

                Kuti attended Abeokuta Grammar School. In 1958, he was sent to London to study medicine but decided 
                to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, with the trumpet being his preferred instrument.
                [4] While there, he formed the band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife.
                [10] In 1960, Kuti married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he had three children
                 (Femi, Yeni, and Sola).[11] In 1963, Kuti moved back to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria, 
                 re-formed Koola Lobitos, and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. 
                 He played for some time with Victor Olaiya and his All-Stars.[12]
                In 1967, Kuti traveled to Ghana looking for a new musical direction.
                [1] He called his style Afrobeat, a combination of highlife, funk, jazz, salsa, calypso, and traditional Yoruba music.
                [1] In 1969, Kuti took the band to the United States and spent ten months in Los Angeles. 
                While there, he discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Sandra Izsadore), 
                a partisan of the Black Panther Party. This experience heavily influenced his music and political views.
                [13] He renamed the band Nigeria 70. Soon after, 
                the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Kuti and his band were in the US without work permits. 
                The band performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as The '69 Los Angeles Sessions.

            <strong>1970s</strong>
            <p id="1970">
                After Kuti and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed (the) Africa 70 as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues.[10] He formed the Kalakuta Republic—a commune, recording studio, and home for many people connected to the band—which he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. According to Lindsay Barrett, the name Kalakuta was derived from the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta dungeon in India.[4] Kuti set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, first named the Afro-Spot and later the Afrika Shrine, where he both performed regularly and officiated at personalised Yoruba traditional ceremonies in honor of his nation's ancestral faith. He also changed his name to Anikulapo (meaning "He who carries death in his pouch", with the interpretation: "I will be the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time for death to take me").[4][15] He stopped using the hyphenated surname "Ransome" because he considered it a slave name.

                Kuti's music was popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general.[16] He decided to sing in Pidgin English so that individuals all over Africa could enjoy his music, where the local languages they speak are diverse and numerous. As popular as Kuti's music had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was unpopular with the ruling government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. During 1972, Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious, with Kuti appearing alongside vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench.[17] Around this time, Kuti became even more involved with the Yoruba religion.[2]
                
                In 1977, Kuti and Africa 70 released the album Zombie, which heavily criticized Nigerian soldiers, and used the zombie metaphor to describe the Nigerian military's methods. The album was a massive success and infuriated the government, who raided the Kalakuta Republic with 1,000 soldiers. During the raid, Kuti was severely beaten, and his elderly mother was fatally injured after being thrown from a window.[4] The commune was burnt down, and Kuti's studio, instruments, and master tapes were destroyed. Kuti claimed that he would have been killed had it not been for a commanding officer's intervention as he was being beaten. Kuti's response to the attack was to deliver his mother's coffin to the Dodan Barracks in Lagos, General Olusegun Obasanjo's residence, and to write two songs, "Coffin for Head of State" and "Unknown Soldier," referencing the official inquiry that claimed an unknown soldier had destroyed the commune.[18]
                
                Kuti and his band took up residence in Crossroads Hotel after the Shrine had been destroyed along with the commune. In 1978, he married 27 women: Kikelomo Oseyni, Folake Oladejo, Tejumade Adebiyi, Naa Lamiley, Sewaa Kuti, Omotola Osaeti, Omowunmi Oyedele, Alake Anikulapo Kuti, Shade Shodeinde, Adeola Williams, Najite Kuti, Emaruagheru Osawe, Kevwe Oghomienor, Ihase Anikulapo, Adejonwo Iyabode Ogunitro, Bose Anikulapo Kuti, Lara Anikulapo Kuti, Suru Eriomola, Tokunbo Akran, Funmi Kuti, Omowunmi Afesumo, Laide Anikulapo Kuti, Ronke Edason, Damiregba Anikulapo Kuti, Aduni Idowu, and Omolara Shosanya Remilekun Taylor. Many of them were dancers, composers, and singers with whom he worked with. The marriage served not only to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic but also to protect Kuti and his wives from authorities' false claims that Kuti was kidnapping women.[19] Later, he adopted a rotation system of maintaining 12 simultaneous wives.[20] There were also two concerts in the year: the first was in Accra, in which rioting broke out during the song "Zombie", which caused Kuti to be banned from entering Ghana; the second was after the Berlin Jazz Festival when most of Kuti's musicians deserted him due to rumors that he planned to use all of the proceeds to fund his presidential campaign.
                
                In 1983, Kuti formed his political party, which he called Movement of the People (MOP), to "clean up society like a mop".[4] MOP preached Nkrumahism and Africanism.[21][22] In 1979, he nominated himself for president in Nigeria's first elections in decades, but his candidature was refused. At this time, Kuti created a new band, Egypt 80, which reflected the view that Egyptian civilization, knowledge, philosophy, mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed as such. Kuti stated in an interview: "Stressing the point that I have to make Africans aware of the fact that Egyptian civilization belongs to the African. So that was the reason why I changed the name of my band to Egypt 80."[23] Kuti continued to record albums and tour the country. He further infuriated the political establishment by implicating ITT Corporation's vice-president, Moshood Abiola, and Obasanjo in the popular 25-minute political screed entitled "I.T.T. (International Thief-Thief)".

                In 1984, Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling. Amnesty International and others denounced the charges as politically motivated.[24] Amnesty designated him a prisoner of conscience,[25] and other human rights groups also took up his case. After 20 months, General Ibrahim Babangida released him from prison. On his release, Kuti divorced his 12 remaining wives, citing "marriage brings jealousy and selfishness".[20]

                Kuti continued to release albums with Egypt 80 and toured in the United States and Europe while continuing to be politically active. In 1986 he performed in Giants Stadium in New Jersey as part of Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope concert along with Bono, Carlos Santana, and the Neville Brothers. In 1989, Kuti and Egypt 80 released the anti-apartheid album Beasts of No Nation that depicted U.S. President Ronald Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and South African State President Pieter Willem Botha on its cover. The title of the composition evolved out of a statement by Botha: "This uprising [against the apartheid system] will bring out the beast in us."[4]
                
                Kuti's album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually, he ceased releasing albums altogether. On 21 January 1993,[26] he and four members of Africa 70 were arrested and were later charged on 25 January for the murder of an electrician.[27] Rumors also speculated that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. However, there had been no confirmed statement from Kuti about this speculation.

            <p id="death"> 
                On 3 August 1997, Kuti's brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, announced Kuti's death the day before from complications related to AIDS. Kuti had been an AIDS denialist,[28] and his widow maintained that he did not die of AIDS.[29][30] His youngest son Seun took the role of leading Kuti's former band Egypt 80. As of 2020, the band is still active, releasing music under the moniker Seun Kuti & Egypt 80.[31]
